## **Healthcare Data Analysis – SQL Queries**  

### **Overview**  
This repository contains SQL scripts used to extract and analyze healthcare data. The dataset includes information on **age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits**. The SQL queries help uncover key insights, such as distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.

## **Insights Explored**  

### **1. Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**  
- Average height and weight by gender  
- Cholesterol distribution across different age groups  
- Percentage of smokers in the dataset  
- Minimum, maximum, and average blood pressure values (`ap_hi` and `ap_low`)  

### **2. Comparisons & Correlations**  
- Do smokers tend to have higher cholesterol levels compared to non-smokers?  
- Is there a significant difference in blood pressure between males and females?  
- How does BMI (Body Mass Index) differ between males and females?  
- Does age have a correlation with cholesterol levels?  

### **3. Hypothesis Testing & Trends**  
- Do males have a higher smoking rate than females?  
- Does high cholesterol correlate with high blood pressure?  
- Are older individuals (above 50) more likely to have high blood pressure?  
- Are smokers more likely to have high blood pressure?
